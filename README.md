# HomoPolymer
Theoretical Model to Simulate Radical Polymerization

Kinetic modelof a polymerization process. The polymer molecules are statistically distributed depending on process parameters.
The package predict the polymer produced based on process variables. The package has a GUi in order to minimize the effort of the user.
The values of the most probable parameters are taken from a very comprehensive work done at the University. See vignettes for all the 
Scientific details.
